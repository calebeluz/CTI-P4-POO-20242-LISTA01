This README presents 25 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** questions, designed to support learning this methodology at the **Maranguape campus**, under the guidance of Roger Moura Sarmento. The questions were developed in **Java** and aim to help students understand and apply the fundamental concepts of OOP.

With a basic level of difficulty, the questions are designed to provide a practical introduction to OOP, allowing students to understand and implement key concepts in a simple and straightforward manner. By solving these questions, students will have the opportunity to strengthen their **programming logic** skills and learn how to use Java to solve basic yet essential problems in software development.

The material is structured to ensure that students can apply what they've learned in practical scenarios, preparing them to move on to more complex OOP topics in the future.
